  dialogueText: This is an example of a drifting waltz time.
  lessonText: 'This is also a waltz, but the middle beat is silent. An unsounded
    beat is called a Rest.

    This rhythm has a very different feel to having all
    the beats sounded.

    Try raycasting the middle slider to change the subdivision
    value.'
